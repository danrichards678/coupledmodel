# Coupled Anisotropic ice model (unfinished)

This model is a full-Stokes solver written in Python and Fenics with the aim of modelling evolving viscous anisotropy coupled to fabric evolution modelled with SpecCAF (Richards et al. 2021). The aim of this model is to allow rapid prototyping of novel anisotropic viscosity formulations and to act as a benchmark for larger-scale parameterisations of anisotropy.
